# YUMMY TUMMY

## Overview

Yummy Tummy is a delightful recipe suggestion application built with Django and styled using Bootstrap 5. It offers a seamless user experience with full CRUD functionality, allowing users to effortlessly create, read, update, and delete their favorite recipes or comments. This project aims to provide a centralized, user-friendly platform for food enthusiasts to discover and manage recipes, enhancing culinary exploration and enjoyment.

We addresses the challenge of meal planning by offering users the option to categorize recipes by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner). This feature helps users to relax and plan their meals accordingly, ensuring a well-organized and enjoyable cooking experience.
